The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique is named after the Italian word for tomato, "pomodoro," inspired by a tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo initially used.

A typical Pomodoro session consists of four 25-minute work intervals, each followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four sessions, a longer break of around 15-30 minutes is taken. The technique aims to enhance focus and productivity by leveraging the principles of regular breaks and timeboxing tasks.

The Pomodoro Technique has gained popularity as a simple yet effective method for managing time and improving concentration, allowing individuals to structure their work efficiently while incorporating regular short breaks to maintain mental freshness.

Using this Technique, I have made an Pomodoro Timer, it has 6 sessions 
session_1 = Work_time(25mins)
session_2 = break_time(5 mins)
session_3 = Work_time(25mins)
session_4 = break_time(5 mins) 
session_5 = Work_time(25mins)
session_6 = long_break_time(20 mins) 

Once start a timer, the timer countdown starts it follows according to the sessions.
